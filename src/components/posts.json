    "title": "Self-Love Practices for Better Mental Health",
    "date": "February 3, 2025",
    "content": "What a complicated, uncomfortable, and downright unnerving concept. Maybe the idea of Self-Love doesn't bother you, but if you are anything like me this is one of the most difficult tasks you have on your to do list. It is such a simple concept, but it is often the simplest of concepts that are the most difficult things to achieve.<>Let us first break down this idea of Self-Love. Again, this is a simple task, but it is far from an easy one. We take the idea of the self and define it as a reflection of who we believe that we are. Then we can take the idea of love and define it as an acceptance of everything good or bad about an entity (person, situation, etc.). Therefore we combine the two, and we define self-love as the acceptance of who we believe ourselves to be. Both the good and the bad parts must be accepted. I would also take this one step further, and say that we must acknowledge the potentially good, or potentially bad, person that we are capable of becoming.<>I use these terms good and bad, but I really dislike using them. However, I have not found any terms that sufficiently substitute good and bad. I tell people sometimes that actions have outcomes that we either like or don't like, and maybe that applies in the self-love situation, maybe it doesn't. My main point is please don't get hung up on the idea of good or bad. Understand that true self-love demands the acceptance of our being in its entirety, whatever that looks like.<>As far as I am concerned at this point it should be relatively easy to see the impact that self-love has on mental health, but if it is not that is A-ok. Let's dive into why self-love is imperative for mental health. So many of us when we are young make tradeoffs, especially in middle and high school because we just want to be accepted by our peers. Many of us will do whatever it takes. Not ironically, this age group tends to suffer the most with mental health issues (I'm shocked!). These tradeoffs oftentimes lead us to become people who we did not intend, nor want to be.<>Why is that important you may ask? After you have made all of these tradeoffs you must somehow accept each and every one you made whether it was one you liked or disliked. This can be really difficult for some, especially given the severity of some of the tradeoffs. For example, if I made fun of a disabled kid (truly horrific in my mind) in order to impress an attractive human I wanted the attention of, it could take me a long time to rectify the circumstances under which I chose to do this.<>I think that understanding that all of these things are a choice is imperative. We have all made choices about who we are going to become in this lifetime. This makes me think of Jocko Willinks Extreme Ownership Concept. We must accept responsibility for everything that we have done in this lifetime up until this point in order to accept who we are, or to love ourselves. This is very important, no one forced me to become a thief, and no one forced me to be a bully, but these things happened.<>Self-love and mental health are two peas of the same pod. It is very hard to have one without the other. I would venture out to say that many mentally healthy people have plenty of self-love, and that very few people who lack self-love are mentally healthy. This was one of my first stops on the journey to mental wellness for me, and I am eternally grateful for the understanding of these concepts. I continuously return to this concept because if I can accept myself in any situation then it doesn't matter what the situation is. The world can be crumbling around me, but provided I approach the situation and myself with love then there is nothing I can't overcome."

    "title": "The Role of Sleep in Mental Reset and Resilience",
    "date": "January 22, 2025",
    "content": "I have been hearing quite a bit about sleep recently. Do this to improve your sleep now! Maybe, whatever solution company X is peddling just may have the solution that I have been looking for. I guess I'll go check it out. Upon checking it out I discover that they are charging far more then I am willing to pay for their particular solution. I already have 25 other things I am paying for to try to optimize myself as a human. What is it that I am supposed to do?<>Don't get me wrong, I am not saying that these products don't work, or that they are not a valid solution for whichever sleep issue that they are addressing. Plenty of these tools work very well, but there are things that I am unwilling to pay for in the hopes that it may help me get a better nights rest, not just sleep.<>Recently I have discovered a formula that has worked really well for me when it comes to getting a restful nights sleep. I keep the room as cold as I can stand it. Typically, this involves me opening my bedroom windows for the duration of the evening which leaves my room in the low 60's. This is a sweet spot for me. I also take magnesium glycinate. Both of these have helped tremendously in me obtaining better sleep.<>That being said even though I was getting better sleep, my sleep quality was still not great. It was better, but I still felt drained regularly. This week I began doing Qigong exercises before bed, and this has revolutionized my sleep. For those who don't know, Qigong utilizes similar principles as Yoga (movement, stretching, and breathing), but originated in China.<>This simple addition, to what I was already doing, made me realize just how important a restful nights sleep was. I have begun waking up without an alarm clock for the first time in my life. My mental fortitude and overall happiness has increased 10-fold. I am less negative, and able to see more of the possibilities of life rather than the harsh realities I chose to see before.<>You may be thinking those three things helped me to sleep more. Not at all. Those three things allowed me to get a more restful nights sleep. I am sleeping the exact same amount of hours, I am actually able to rest deeply and fully. This is opposed to going through the motions of sleep because I have to. Best of all, 2 of the 3 I do before bed are completely free. Light stretching and breath work, in tandem, may take some of my time, but I get that time back ten times because I wake up refreshed and ready to take on the challenges of the day.<>That is a big deal for me because I work quite a bit these days due to having many irons in the fire, so to speak. There are challenges daily that arise, and I need to be at my best mentally in order to be able address them successfully. Finding the right formula for me to achieve greater quality sleep has been instrumental in ensuring that I show up each and every day at my very best.<>If you are struggling with poor sleep quality it's completely understandable. Especially as we get older getting quality sleep becomes more and more difficult. However, discovering what environment you sleep best in, and investing in a tool or two can assist you in ways you never imagined.<>If you think you have tried everything there is to try and are still not getting the right quality of sleep, I hear you. I have been trying to latest and the greatest tools for the past few years. Many of these tools have yielded little, if any, results. Hang in there and keep going, and you will find the formula that helps you. Your mind and body will thank you if you don't give up. It can be frustrating, but giving up is easy, and won't fix any of the problems you are currently experiencing. Keep it up, put one foot in front of the other and keep trying. It'll all pay off in the end even when there seems to be no end in sight."

    "title": "Mindful Journaling: Starting the Year with Clarity",
    "date": "January 15, 2025",
    "content": "The idea of creating resolutions dates back thousands of years. Typically, they were for religious purposes, but is nevertheless a practice that humans have been doing for quite a long time. Nowadays, the religious aspect may have gone away, but we are still just as concerned with starting the New Year off right with our many resolutions we come up with each year.<>Given the amount of attention we give to New Years Resolutions one would think that we as humans must have some proclivity to reviewing our lives in the hopes that we are able to transform our existence into something we are proud of. Unfortunately, 80-90% of us will never actually reach those lofty goals that we set out to accomplish. Researchers have identified many barriers that keep us from accomplishing these goals, but today I am going to focus on one of them, Mindful Journaling.<>One of the reasons that people fail to achieve their goals is a lack of progress tracking. This directly relates to the idea of mindful journaling. You may ask what is the difference between tracking your progress, and mindful journaling? The best way that I can describe those differences is trough the following anecdote.<>I recently began tracking the progress on my goals for for 2025 because I didn't think that I did a good enough job with this in 2024. With the assistance of an AI I identified a list of questions for a weekly review, and a daily review. I plan to do a monthly review as well, but I have yet to complete that task. I eagerly began journaling everyday, and very quickly noticed that I was simply going through the motions when it came to the daily journaling. I was restating many of the things that I said in prior days, and it was more of a headache then an aid for me.<>While the daily journaling assisted less than I would have hoped, I found the weekly journaling had a profound impact on my focus and resilience. I discovered that it helped me to remain focused on what was important for the week, and made sure that I stuck to what was important throughout the week.<>Now, you may ask how in the world does this highlight mindful journaling? It shows that I was aware enough to understand that the daily journaling I was doing was not efficient. This could be because the questions I was asking were not the right ones to ask. It could be because of a plethora of other reasons, but all I am aware of this time is that daily journaling at this moment is not productive for me.<>Again, this raises a questions that needs to be addressed. What if daily journaling is working for someone else, and not weekly? Great! That is wonderful, I am ecstatic that someone has found something that works for them. This is always something to be celebrated. It is a blessing when people identify a tool or practice that aids them on the epic adventure of life.<>This is where the mindful aspect comes into play. It is not enough to just journal, or utilize a new practice. You must do it in a manner which involves presence, more specifically your presence, or for me, my presence. If I am not present mentally, emotionally, or spiritually when utilizing these tools then I may not notice that a practice is making a major impact on my life, and I stopped because I didn't notice the effect. On the flip side, I may be continuing a practice that is causing me distress in some way and I am not aware enough to notice. Both can have detrimental effects, and prevent us from becoming the limitless beings that we all have inside of us.<>It is imperative that we journal. Having some way of releasing the thoughts in our mind for review, or just because it's Tuesday, is necessary for modern humans. This is a relatively simple task. Carve out a few minutes each week to go ahead and review how it is your doing. I am sure some of you immediately said \"I don't have any time.\" Make the time for yourself. There are a lot of things I don't have time for, but when I make the time for them my life improves exponentially.<>Doing this in a mindful manner can have effects on your life that you never thought possible. If it doesn't work for you then all you lost were a few minutes while you tried. However, if it works the benefits are innumerable. Take action today, download a notes app, buy a paper journal. Personalize it, make it your own so that you are more likely to do it. Your future self will thank you for it."

    "title": "How to Avoid Burnout After New Year’s Highs",
    "date": "January 8, 2025",
    "content": "I knew a guy who loved to consume alcoholic beverages. We would hang out and he would start consuming large amounts of liquor immediately. Our buddy would always remind them that it is a marathon and not a sprint, to which our friend never listened. This would lead to him passed out within an hour or two, and everyone taking turns embarrassing him while he was passed out.<>This situation is very similar to experiencing burnout while trying to achieve our new years goals. If we come out the gate on January 1 and hit the ground running thats great. This is exactly what we were looking for. However, if we try to accomplish too much too quickly then it will be us who rapidly depletes our energy and motivation, leading to burnout before the year has even begun.<>This is the exact opposite of what we want to have happen at the beginning of the year. We want to carry our resolution long into the new year, not fizzle out after a couple of weeks. How do we overcome this? For me, I always have to keep in mind that when trying to achieve my new years resolutions it is a marathon not a sprint. I am not meant to start out the gate as fast as humanly possible, and sputter out halfway through the first or second lap. I need to control the release of my energy to be able to sustain 24 laps at a steady pace.<>This takes a few different forms. One of those is remembering that I still need rest. Just because it is the beginning of the year, and I have some extra energy from the holidays, doesn't mean I have to expend that energy immediately. I can take a day off if my muscles are too sore. I can work a different muscle group if I need to. These are all options especially when it comes to achieving physical goals. This has always been an area, historically, that I have struggled to maintain that marathon mindset.<>Another form it can take is in performing creative or mental work. I desperately want to create as much content as I possibly can, but if I attempt to create too much at one point in time, then all I have managed to do is create subpar content that no one will want to engage with. This is the opposite outcome that I want to happen, so I need to remember to pace myself in creative endeavors as well.<>This all leads me to the way that I tend to see work overall. Work is necessary, whether you like the work you do or not. Whether you found that career that you love or not, burnout can still occur if we push ourselves too hard too fast. Keeping in mind that we make progress through small consistent actions, rather than huge actions taken all at once is mandatory. Additionally, one thought that always helps me when I am on the verge of burnout, which happens more than I care to admit, is that I know absolutely no one who sat on their deathbed saying \"I really wish I had worked more.\"<>Do what you have to do, don't use this as an excuse to exist solely in comfort. Push yourself in a healthy and meaningful way that will allow you to complete the marathon that is your life. It's the longest one I know of, at an average of 73 years. Most marathons only take a few hours to complete, so don't try to sprint to the finish line. Accomplish those small victories. Celebrate them, and internalize them before jumping to the next. It is much more effective to make small consistent progress, than massive leaps all at once."

    "title": "Setting Intentions vs. Resolutions for Mental Wellness",
    "date": "January 1, 2025",
    "content": "We have all been asked at some point in time what are your new years resolutions. Many of us respond with something that has been bothering us throughout the past year, some respond with \"I haven't thought about it yet,\" and some don't bother to set any resolutions at all (hard to believe, but I know a few). The idea of having resolutions, or a determination to do or not do something, is important for mental health and wellness.<>If we do not want to continue carrying out a specific behavior that's ok, but how will we overcome it if we do not have any resolve to ensure that it doesn't happen again? Having resolutions is a great thing, and we should all take some time at the beginning of the year to determine what we do and do not want to do throughout the next year. It is tremendously helpful in allowing us to stay focused on what's important to us. This allows us to feel more connected, satisfied, and fulfilled. Ultimately leading to better mental health and wellbeing.<>Now it may seem that we have found an answer to living a happier and better state of mental wellbeing, but this may not be the case. Resolutions are great, and having determination to carry out these resolutions are fantastic, but not having a plan can be crippling to one's New Years Resolutions. Many of us set out with the epic resolutions that are going to revolutionize the way we live just to give up on them mere weeks into the new year.<>Setting intentions is one way to aid us in carrying out our new years resolutions. When it comes to setting intentions, it is really about having a plan. Having a determination to do, or not do, something is wonderful, but combining that with a solid plan of action to achieve that resolution can only help us in achieving those resolutions we so deeply desire.<>When I create a plan along with my determination very few things can stop me from achieving that goal. It is like supercharging my focus because not only do I have a deep urge to succeed in my endeavors, I also have a foundation that I can build upon by taking the necessary actions. Having a plan assists me in taking those required actions each and every day. Having focus and a plan to achieve my goals makes it so that I am much more likely to achieve those goals.<>The beauty of setting resolutions and intentions like this is that it can be done at any point in time throughout the year. Anyone can set a resolution and intention at any point and begin taking action to accomplish their goals. It is not strictly limited to performing this action in January. However, that being said if you are at a point in life where your awareness settled on creating those resolutions around the new year that's ok. The key is having determination with a solid plan, and you can start taking action to change your life immediately.<>The title of this post is certainly misleading, but as far as I am concerned, is one of the most important things to keep in mind heading into the new year. Resolutions and intentions are not at opposition with each other, but rather are meant to work in tandem. If you can enter the new year with determination (resolution) and a solid plan (intention) then you are much more likely to succeed in your endeavors, and catapult your mental wellness to the place you want it to be in the new year. Get out there write down those resolutions, develop a plan that will help you achieve them, and watch as your life slowly transforms into what you have always wanted."

    "title": "Looking Ahead: Preparing Your Mind for a New Year",
    "date": "December 11, 2024",
    "content": "I am unsure which concept I like more, looking ahead or preparing. Both of these concepts are incredible important in the pursuit of mental health. In my opinion it is very difficult to be mentally healthy without doing both of these things.<>The first concept, looking ahead, is tremendously important. You may be thinking why in the world is important to look ahead, shouldn't I be practicing mindfulness? Yes, of course you should, but we all need goals and purpose. Looking ahead is one way to find those goals that we need to obtain in order to determine our purpose. This is not something that you need to focus on every second of every day, but you should be thinking about where you want to be by the end of next year at the very least.<>Ideally, you have though even further than that. I once did an exercise where I wrote my obituary and then I worked backward from that. Going back in decade long increments I thought about what I wanted my life to look like at each stage of life. This wasn't a depressing exercise, but rather an uplifting one. It helped to see exactly where I wanted to be at each stage of life, and make goals accordingly.<>One of my favorite books is __The Lion Tracker's guide to life__ by Boyd Varty. I re-read this book every year. In it he talks about not always knowing where he is going, but he knows the process to be able to get there. The process of setting goals, and looking ahead helps us to know which actions to take to get to where we ultimately want to get to which is invaluable. This is especially helpful in moments of semi or complete darkness, and it is difficult to see what the next steps in life are.<>The second concept of preparing your mind is just as important as looking ahead. How is it that I can be ready to experience what I want if I am not in the right mindset. For example, if I want a certain outcome, but my mindset exists in a different outcome then I am won't be available to experience that which I have begun to work for. A more tangible example of this is from when I was attending grad school. I was interesting in technology, and wanted to be a part of building something new that would aid in transforming people's lives. To this end I began building technology, eventually creating a couple of startups. The first startup I created prepared me, and assisted me in developing the mindset I needed in order to create my second startup(both of which are still functioning today).<>If I hadn't known where I wanted to go, and began to seek experiences that would develop my mindset then none of those startups would've been possible. This was a direct result of looking ahead and knowing what I wanted my life to look like. I then began seeking out those experiences that would develop my mindset. Experiences that would mold and shape my way of thinking, so that I would be available when the time came to experience that which I have worked so hard for.<>Those are just my examples, and they may not be anything that you are interested in. I totally understand that. This method will work whether you are looking to spend more quality time with family, or whether you want to be the next ruler of the free world. Your mindset is everything when it comes to determining the life around you, and it is difficult to develop that mindset if you do not know where it is that you want to go.<>As the new year approaches do yourself a favor and find a place where you can be quiet for a little bit. The amount of time however long you can afford to be away from others for. For some this may be an hour, for some this could be 5 minutes. Either way make that time. If it is 5 minutes take the time, and do it over the course of a few days. Use that time to determine what it is you want your life to look like over the next year. Write out in as much detail as possible exactly what it is that you are looking for. After that write out some goals that will help you begin to achieve those goals. Once you have achieved those goals keep going. Write some more, and no matter what keep taking action towards what it is that you want. One of the most comforting thoughts for me is that I may not reach all my goals, but I know for a fact that no one can take away the fact that I used every day of my life to attempt to achieve my goals."

    "title": "Prioritizing Mental Wellness During Busy Seasons",
    "date": "December 6, 2024",
    "content": "Prioritizing mental wellness during busy seasons is, as far as I am concerned, a controversial topic. You may be thinking why in the world would this be controversial? Isn't this supposed to be what I am doing? This is what people are telling me to do, are you telling me that I shouldn't?<>No, I am not disagreeing with anyone, nor am I telling you that you should not prioritize your mental wellness during the holidays. I find this controversial because your mental wellbeing should be a priority all throughout the year not just during the holidays. If your anything like me I do not experience mental discomfort on during the holiday season. I experience it constantly throughout the year.<>It is important to note a couple of things from the prior statements. Number one being that mental health should be a priority. I did not state that mental health should be the priority. At some points in time it is going to become complicated to put your mental health first at all points in time. Life happens and you are going to need to prioritize other tasks given the situation. Make sure that you are addressing those events that need to take precedence. For example, if I there is an issue that arise with my kid that requires my immediate attention, but I tell myself I need to prioritize my mental health the situation will only end poorly. Why? because addressing the situation in that moment is a part of me being mentally healthy. If I ignore the situation I am only deteriorating my mental wellbeing by avoiding the situation that is demanding my attention.<>All that being said being healthy is incredibly important for many things related to the holidays. It assists us in showing up for family, in enjoying whatever is going on around us, and it is difficult to show up the way we need to if we are not mentally healthy. However, one of the best ways to remain mentally healthy is by dealing with the unexpected happenings of life as they arise. Procrastination is the worst thing one can do when it comes to remaining mentally healthy. If we look at the prior example I gave, that situation is going to sit in the back of my mind, and annoy me like a gnat until I get up and take care of it. There is no way short of turning to distractions like social media, tv, alcohol, etc. to not have those things we need to do in the back of our mind.<>The beautiful thing about, and quite possibly the most infuriating thing, about the human mind is it tends to know exactly what it needs in order to be healthy (or move forward). This makes it easy to identify the problem, and the solution, but it also makes it incredibly difficult if you are not in a willing state of mind to address those issues.<>I relay to everyone I have ever worked with in this lifetime that willingness is 80% of the battle. If I remain willing then it makes no difference if I address my mental issue right away, or in a day or two because I am not avoiding it. Avoidance is the quickest and most effective way to mental illness. Both fortunately, and unfortunately, we live in a era of distraction. It is super easy to pick up a phone and open a social media app where distractions are abundant. I am not trying to demonize distractions because there is a time where they play a vital role. As with everything there is a time and a place for a distraction and it is up to us to identify those times. Remember, our mind knows the difference between us facing our mental struggles head on, and when we are just trying to act like they don't exist.<>When prioritizing mental wellness during the holidays the important thing to remember is just to be willing to put your mental wellbeing as one of your priorities. This is the most effective way to make sure that you are able to address all the challenges of the holidays, while also maintaining your mental wellbeing. You may be thinking that it sounds like complete BS, but to that I would say don't knock it till your try it. Become completely willing, the key word being completely, not 40, 50 or 70% willing. If you can become completely willing to making your mental wellbeing a priority then you will be amazed at what you can handle during the holidays."

    "title": "How to Say No Without Feeling Guilty",
    "date": "December 4, 2024",
    "content": "I am going to start this out with an underrated quote that many know all too well, \"Just do it\" (Seriously, I never would've thought of that). I know it seems simple, and saying no is that simple. However, this is not where the difficulty arises when agreeing, or not agreeing, to give up your valuable time during the holidays.<>Typically, the guilt that is experienced when either saying no, or not saying no stems from some element of trauma. In reality saying no to anyone is not a big deal, and many will not even bat an eyelash if you state you aren't able to attend an event. If they do chances are they have some unresolved trauma themselves (SHOCKER). Happy Healthy humans are not going to berate you, think less of you, or manipulate you because you are too busy during one of the busiest times of the year to make their holiday cookie party. That being said if you bail on people regularly, and your friends haven't seen you in months because you say no all the time this is a different beast entirely.<>I think we have hit on the most important thing which becomes more challenging during these times, especially if you have a history of struggling with mental health. That idea is being a happy healthy human. Sounds super easy, but as someone who struggled with mental health for over a decade it is nowhere near as easy as it sounds.<>I remember when I was young thinking why am I not happy? Why do I always want to be someone else? Why is what I have not good enough? These were hard questions to answer. It took me over a decade to address them because of them were neurological, not mental. I had suffered a few blows to the head growing up that significantly impacted my mental wellbeing. It took a long time to realize this, and to find the solution that would help me overcome these obstacles (The trick was increasing blood flow and Oxygen to my brain, I still have the book that helped me with this). Something as simple as just be happy, or just say no becomes incredibly challenging when your brain is not functioning the way that it should be.<>The solution start the journey towards becoming mentally healthy today. Don't start tomorrow do it right now. Make the commitment, and decide the first steps to get there. The road to becoming a happy healthy human does not happen overnight. As they say Rome was not built in a day, but it was built brick by brick. Anyone can overcome significant mental health challenges one step at a time. The first step can be as small as telling a loved one you are struggling, and thinking about getting help. It can be as big as scheduling an appointment with a therapist, a psychologist, or a social worker. Any step you take no matter how big or small will aid you in your journey to becoming a happy healthy human. Please take the first step now, you will thank you for it."

    "title": "Managing Holiday Stress",
    "date": "December 4, 2024",
    "content": "The holidays are a difficult time for so many of us, myself included. This time of year is especially complicated being that there are so many holidays back to back. Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years all happening within a month of each other. This is a lot to process for anyone, let alone if you are a member of the neurodivergent community.<>If your family is anything like mine then that means that it is not only one day of celebration for these holidays, but many days of celebration for the holidays. For Thanksgiving alone we had three days of celebrations (Imagine the Christmas holiday, which is much more important in my family). This is far from a complaint because I do love my family and appreciate their company, but this is a lot of personalities for myself to deal with.<>Just a few years ago this was far too much for me to deal with. I would typically have a combination of not going to some of the events, while also spending as little time as I needed to in order to be considered as an attendee of the event. This is not anything that I am proud of, but being around family for that amount of time was simply a lot of stress.<>I have addressed the stress of family, but unfortunately this is not the only stressors that we experience around this time of year. Financial pressures mount because if you celebrate Christmas there are presents that must be bought. This is typically an expense that is outside of your normal expenses, and requires some extra budgeting in order for it to be managed effectively.<>In addition to the prior two stressors there is also the stress induced by the change in environment. Where I live the weather not only gets significantly colder, but also considerably darker. Whereas I am used to it being light until 7 at night, suddenly it is dark by 4. This change can lead to seasonal depression in some, which is no laughing matter.<>I know what you may be thinking, \"Hey A-hole, its great you have identified all these issues, but is there a solution\". Of course I have some solutions. There may even be one works for you (at least that is my hope). One solution that I rely on is to remember that I still have needs that must be addressed during the holidays. Personally, I am an introvert, so I need my alone time in order to process the world around me. I must take time for myself in order to go for a walk, or read a book. If not the holidays just got one step closer to being overwhelming.<>You may be thinking what if I am not that self-aware yet. That's ok, take a brief inventory before the holidays begin. Ask yourself the question in quiet contemplation, what do I need in order to relax during the holidays? Ask yourself how you can remain level headed throughout the holidays. You have the answers inside, you simply need to bring them into your awareness. You will be amazed if you sit down and ask yourself the questions about the things that bother you the most during the holidays. The answers will come almost immediately if you can sit quietly enough. This does not mean traditional meditation, it just means to sit or walk with no distractions. That means no phone, no other technological devices, and also doing it in solitude. I know the later may be complicated for some, especially single parents, but take 5 minutes when your kids go to sleep, and take this inventory. You will thank yourself for doing it.<>My favorite strategy to use during the holidays is to find a way to be of service. This can be of service to your family, or you can do things for others in your community. This is such an underrated strategy to avoid feeling overwhelmed. When we exist inside of our own bubble it is easy to see our bubble as all there is. Being of service to those around you tends to put everything in perspective, and allow you to appreciate the little things in your life. I personally find ways to be of service at family functions because there are few better ways to stop thinking about myself, than to think about what I can do for other people.<>The holidays are most certainly a stressful time, and very quickly can become overwhelming. However, just because they can be stressful, or they can be overwhelming does not mean that they have to be. Even if you have never had a positive family interaction during the holidays for over two decades it is never too late to form new habits, and begin enjoying the holidays again."

    "content": "Family dynamics are quite the foray into emotional and mental resilience. For so many years the struggle with family dynamics were a plague that I was determined to stay far away from. However, since the birth of my first child I was forced to rethink those my approach to those dynamics.<>Don't get me wrong there are very few things that make the dynamics of family easier, but that doesn't mean that they are destined to be unpleasant forever. As I have spoken about in prior posts I do believe that this is a matter of walking in with the right mindset.<>I am hoping that it is painfully obvious that mindset is not a cure all penicillin. There is no way to will away generational patterns. That comes with hard work and addressing those deep rooted emotions that can send us into a pattern of seething rage, or decapitating depression. That being said that doesn't mean that you have to avoid your family while working through these deep rooted psychological complications.<>If the first thought I have when going to see my family is \"Oh no, this is going to be awful\", then the chances of that wonderful family that only wants the best for me is going to push my buttons the wrong way will jump exponentially higher. If I approach the situation with love, kindness, and excitement then it is much less likely that those same wonderful people will hit those buttons on purpose. There may be an accident here and there, but those moments happen considerably less with the right mindset.<>Family is one of the greatest gifts that any human can have. They are people who will show up for you when things are darkest. They are the only people who stick around for the majority of life, and not simply be there for a year or two at most like many of the humans we will interact with throughout our lives. To pay homage to the prior post having that attitude of gratitude for those people who will be there through thick and thin will forever change the way that you interact with your loved ones."

    "title": "How to Reflect on the Year Without Self-Judgment",
    "date": "November 19, 2024",
    "content": "\"An unexamined life is not worth living\". What a message from everyones favorite 5th century BCE philosopher. Who would of thought when he uttered these sagacious words that they would stick around for a few thousand years. Which in my mind leads me to deduce that this must be an incredibly important statement that can have profound impacts on ones life.<>That being said reflection can come with serious issues if not done with care. Typically, with care for oneself. It is incredibly easy to look down on oneself for not being good enough, smart enough, for making silly mistakes, etc. The list goes on and on, and the possibilities of judgmental reflection are far too many to list here.<>One thing that I do everything within my power to do is look at my life with absolutely no judgment at all. Now I know what your thinking, \"F this guy, its not easy\". That assessment would be accurate. However, I have found that it is typically related to mindset. Personally, my mindset determines the level of judgment in my self-reflection.<>One thing that I continually remind myself is that nothing that I do in this lifetime is good or bad. It simply isn't that black and white. This thought in and of itself is super helpful in reflecting on life in a non-critical manner. Based on the actions that I take, there are reactions (consequences, but I dislike this word) that I like, and reactions (again substitute consequences if you want) that I don't like. Due to this fact it is imperative that I analyze life each day.<>Personally, I have a tendency to over examine my life, which I am in no way shape or form advocating for. This is enough to drive any sane person insane very quickly. However, I have an uncanny ability to look at that same life with absolutely no judgment. This lack of judgment affords me the ability to remain in the mindset that I want to be in. It allows me to make changes in my life that are beneficial to keeping that mindset. That keep my mind from deteriorating to a level that I find unacceptable. Allowing me to avoid the depths of despair that plagued me as an adolescent, and young adult.<>Examine your life, its great for you. Do so with the understanding that all things are neither good nor bad, they simply have reactions(or consequences) that you want or don't. As soon as you determine which reactions you want keep taking those actions. It will aid you in building the life that you want to live. While Rome may not have been built in a day, it was built brick by brick, which is all you need to do to build a better, healthier life.<>"

    "content": "Practicing Gratitude is something that I always thought was absolutely ridiculous. I remember many times throughout my life people telling me to have an \"attitude of gratitude\". At that same moment I remember thinking \"F**k you, thats a bunch of phooey\". I understand that its good to be grateful for what you have, but me telling myself I am grateful for something is not going to do anything in my life.<>Most of the people who I saw running around telling me how grateful they were seemed like they were full of bologna. It seemed so fake and phony, and I wanted absolutely nothing to do gratitude. Maybe it wasn't gratitude that I didn't want anything to do with, but rather that I wanted nothing to do with what I believed to be inauthentic words that couldn't possibly affect my daily living.<>Over a decade later I now realize how wrong I truly was. Not about the lack of authenticity from those preaching gratitude, but wrong about the fact that the act of listing things one is grateful for has a profound impact on our daily lives.<>One of the big problems with gratitude is that it is not immediate. It takes time for the daily gratitude practice to begin to produce an effect. Being an impatient human that was a hard pill to swallow. However, once ones mindset begins to shift towards gratitude Amazing things begin to happen. The circumstances of life will begin to shift, but this takes even longer than he mind.<>The best thing that comes from having an attitude of gratitude is that for the first time in my life, I have been able to sit back and say that I am happy. To come from some of the darkest recesses of the human mind where there is nothing other than a black abyss swallowing us on a day to day basis to being able to say I am happy for the first time in my life is a major shift. It is a shift that is worth every day that I practiced gratitude and saw absolutely no results. It made the years that I spent ignoring gratitude because of its alleged lack of authenticity worth it because now I would not go a single day without finding something to be grateful for.<>Gratitude produces such a strong mental shift that it should never be understated. You may run into someone who you think is full of bologna, spouting off all kinds of ridiculous things they are grateful for. That's ok, join them. Embrace the phony act of faking it till you make it. Whatever you do, just practice being grateful for the things around you because eventually it is inevitable that your mindset will shift, and your life will become something that you no longer recognize in the best way possible."
